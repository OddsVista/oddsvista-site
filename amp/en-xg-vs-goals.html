<h1>xG vs Goals</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Goals</b> = outcome; <b>xG</b> = process & chance quality.</li>
  <li>Large gaps (xG ≫ goals) often regress; check shot locations & blocks.</li>
  <li>Finishing talent exists, but smaller than fans think — sample size matters.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Use both: price forward-looking with xG; evaluate luck with Goals−xG.</p>
