<h1>Live Betting Principles</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Latency:</b> TV delays, streams, and book delays → size down.</li>
  <li><b>Priors:</b> keep your pre-match model; update with shots/xThreat/cards.</li>
  <li><b>Suspensions:</b> know the rules for VAR, pens, corners, red cards.</li>
  <li><b>Liquidity:</b> spreads fill faster than exotics; avoid thin tails.</li>
</ul>
<p class="warn">In-play mistakes compound quickly. Tighten units and review execution logs.</p>
