<h1>Odds Comparison</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Normalize to <b>decimal odds</b>; compute implied% and overround.</li>
  <li>Match <b>market types</b> (2-way vs 3-way) and settlement rules (ET, OT).</li>
  <li>Prefer net-of-fee price; track historical best-price rate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tip">Tiny price edges across many bets > rare giant edges that never fill.</p>
